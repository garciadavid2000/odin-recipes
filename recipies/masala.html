    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Chicken tikka masala rice is a delicious and popular dish that combines
      two classic Indian recipes: chicken tikka masala and rice. It typically
      consists of succulent pieces of chicken, marinated in a yogurt and spice
      mixture, which are then grilled or roasted until tender and slightly
      charred. The chicken is then simmered in a creamy tomato-based sauce,
      infused with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam
      masala. This flavorful sauce is usually creamy and slightly tangy, with a
      hint of smokiness. To complete the dish, the chicken tikka masala is
      served on a bed of fluffy basmati rice. The rice is often cooked
      separately and seasoned with spices like cumin seeds, cardamom pods, and
      cinnamon for added fragrance and taste. The combination of tender chicken
      tikka, rich and creamy tomato sauce, and aromatic rice creates a
      satisfying and well-balanced meal with layers of flavors. Chicken tikka
      masala rice is a popular choice in Indian restaurants and takeaways, and
      it has gained popularity worldwide as a beloved fusion dish. It offers a
      delightful blend of textures, colors, and tastes, making it a favorite
      among those who appreciate the vibrant and diverse flavors of Indian
      cuisine.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pound (450 grams) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into
        bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 can (14 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
      <li>3 cups cooked basmati rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder,
        paprika, garam masala, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade.
        Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour, or refrigerate overnight for best results.



        <li>Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat. Cook the marinated chicken until it is cooked
        through and slightly charred, about 8-10 minutes per side. Set aside.
    


        In a large skillet or pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until 
        it turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for an additional 
        1-2 minutes.
    


        Add the diced tomatoes to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then, using an immersion blender 
        or a regular blender, puree the tomato mixture until smooth.
    


        Stir in the heavy cream and cooked chicken tikka pieces into the tomato sauce. Allow the mixture to simmer over 
        low heat for 10-15 minutes, until the flavors meld together.
    


        In the meantime, reheat the cooked basmati rice. You can do this by steaming it for a few minutes or warming it 
        in the microwave.
    

        
        To serve, place a portion of basmati rice on a plate or bowl and ladle the chicken tikka masala sauce over it. 
        Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
