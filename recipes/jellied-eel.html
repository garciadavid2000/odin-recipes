    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Jellied eels are a traditional British dish that originated in the 
      East End of London. As the name suggests, it consists of eels that 
      have been cooked in a seasoned broth and then left to cool and set, 
      resulting in a jelly-like texture. The eels are typically simmered 
      with ingredients like vinegar, herbs, and spices to create a flavorful 
      stock. Once cooked, the eels are left to cool, allowing the natural gelatin 
      from the eel's skin and bones to solidify the broth into a jelly. The dish 
      is traditionally served cold, with the jellied eels and their accompanying 
      jelly being enjoyed together. Jellied eels have a unique taste and texture that 
      is both rich and slightly gelatinous, making it a distinctive and acquired culinary 
      experience. While once a staple of London's working-class cuisine, jellied eels are 
      now less commonly consumed but still cherished by some as a nostalgic and traditional 
      British delicacy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      2 pounds (900 grams) eels, cleaned and skinned
      2 cups water
      1 cup white wine vinegar
      1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped
      2 cloves garlic, crushed
      1 bay leaf
      1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
      Salt, to taste
      Lemon wedges and parsley, for garnish (optional)
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      Cut the cleaned and skinned eels into small pieces, around 2-3 inches in length.

      In a large pot, combine the water, white wine vinegar, chopped onion, crushed 
      garlic, bay leaf, and black peppercorns. Season with salt to taste.
  
      Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to 
      low and carefully add the eel pieces to the pot.
  
      Simmer the eels gently for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through 
      and tender. Skim off any impurities or foam that rise to the surface during cooking.
  
      Once the eels are cooked, carefully remove them from the cooking liquid using a 
      slotted spoon and set them aside. Discard the bay leaf and peppercorns from the cooking liquid.
  
      Pour the remaining cooking liquid into a shallow dish or individual serving containers, 
      ensuring that the eels are fully submerged. Allow the liquid to cool.
  
      Once cooled, place the dish or containers in the refrigerator to chill and set for at 
      least 4-6 hours, or overnight.
  
      Serve the jellied eels cold, either as a standalone dish or as part of a traditional 
      British meal. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley, if desired.
