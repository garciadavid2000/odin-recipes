    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Jellied eels are a traditional British dish that originated in the 
      East End of London. As the name suggests, it consists of eels that 
      have been cooked in a seasoned broth and then left to cool and set, 
      resulting in a jelly-like texture. The eels are typically simmered 
      with ingredients like vinegar, herbs, and spices to create a flavorful 
      stock. Once cooked, the eels are left to cool, allowing the natural gelatin 
      from the eel's skin and bones to solidify the broth into a jelly. The dish 
      is traditionally served cold, with the jellied eels and their accompanying 
      jelly being enjoyed together. Jellied eels have a unique taste and texture that 
      is both rich and slightly gelatinous, making it a distinctive and acquired culinary 
      experience. While once a staple of London's working-class cuisine, jellied eels are 
      now less commonly consumed but still cherished by some as a nostalgic and traditional 
      British delicacy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds (900 grams) eels, cleaned and skinned</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 cup white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Lemon wedges and parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the cleaned and skinned eels into small pieces, around 2-3 inches in length.</li>

      <li>In a large pot, combine the water, white wine vinegar, chopped onion, crushed 
      garlic, bay leaf, and black peppercorns. Season with salt to taste.</li>
  
      <li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to 
      low and carefully add the eel pieces to the pot.</li>
  
      <li>Simmer the eels gently for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through 
      and tender. Skim off any impurities or foam that rise to the surface during cooking.</li>
  
      <li>Once the eels are cooked, carefully remove them from the cooking liquid using a 
      slotted spoon and set them aside. Discard the bay leaf and peppercorns from the cooking liquid.</li>
  
      <li>Pour the remaining cooking liquid into a shallow dish or individual serving containers, 
      ensuring that the eels are fully submerged. Allow the liquid to cool.</li>
  
      <li>Once cooled, place the dish or containers in the refrigerator to chill and set for at 
      least 4-6 hours, or overnight.</li>
  
      <li>Serve the jellied eels cold, either as a standalone dish or as part of a traditional 
      British meal. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
